1. Setting up ELK.

- Execute setup.sh script to set necessary permissions for log and data directories.
- Run docker-compose up -d (or without -d for debugging) 
- It will start elasticsearch, elasticalert, kibana and logstash on your machine.
- Logstash will listen on 5044 for incoming beats and Kibana will listen on 5061 for its webserver.
- To check if it is installed successfully, open localhost:5061 and you should see Kibana interface.


2. Setting up Filebeat

- Execute setup.sh script to set necessary permissions for config and data files/directories.
- open docker-compose.yml in filebeat-setup folder.
- Map the tomcat log directory to /usr/share/filebeat/logs/tomcat directory
- start docker-compose up -d (or without -d for debugging)
- open filbeat-setup/filebeat/filebeat.yml and change the IP of the machine where logstash is running. 127.0.0.1 for localhost. (sample given below) 

output.logstash:
  # The Logstash hosts
  enabled: true
  hosts: ["192.168.142.200:5044"]
  index: filebeat_logs


3. To check if filebeat is correctly sending the data to ELK.
- Make sure that ELK is up and running
- Make sure that filebeat is up and running
- On Kibana dashboard click on Discover tab and you should see a set of indices
